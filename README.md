### Dependencies: 
Django: `python -m pip install Django`
pgvector: `pip install pgvector`
psycopg2: `python -m pip install psycopg2-binary`

### Env:
Set `OPENAI_KEY` environment variable. 

### Spin up server: 
Run the command: `python manage.py runserver`. 
Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index/`. This should contain the list of existing blog posts, along with a preview of its embedding vector (generated by the `text-embedding-3-small` model).

### Notes 
Pgvector integration in these files: 
- Models. Embeddings class's "embedding" attribute is a VectorField: https://github.com/esca8/pgvector_django_app/blob/main/blog/models.py
- Views. Index page orders the search results by L2Distance: https://github.com/esca8/pgvector_django_app/blob/main/blog/views.py

### Further developments: 
- Options to search by regex vs. content
- Search by category (discussion posts / homework / textbook chapters)
- Similar to Google's "gemini summary", perhaps provide search results to GPT to generate summary?

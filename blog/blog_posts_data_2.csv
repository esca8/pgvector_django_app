"Visited configuration","In my TM, I keep track of the list of configurations when the TM runs. Can I say that if a configuration is visited twice then the TM is looping forever? Or do I have to explain further?","homework4.5"
"Showing cardinality of algebraic numbers","For this question, I tried to diagonalize against the set of all algebraic numbers. To apply the diagonalization lemma, I wanted to show that the cardinality of this set is equivalent to the naturals. To do this, I used the CS method and encoded an algebraic number as a tuple consisting of the polynomial it was a root of and a number indicating what root of the polynomial it was. However, I'm not sure if this is making too many logical jumps â€“ can I assume that you can 'know' the polynomial a number is a root of? Is it an injection to denote it this way?","homework4.2"

"Strategy for Transcendental numbers exist (SOLO)","I am currently trying to prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. However, I am having difficulty finding an injection to prove so. I think it should be something along the line of injecting from the set of integer coef polynomials (which is a countable set) to their respective roots. However, each polynomial can have multiple roots so this wouldn't work. Am I on the right track with this line of thinking and can I have some guidance?","homework4.2",
"I think I'm misunderstanding the problem","If reals are either algebraic or not, and if I show that algebraic numbers are countable, then I would be done. I really think I'm missing some part of the problem that makes it more non trivial than I think it is, so a clarification would really help, thanks!","homework4.2",
"Ensuring the decider TM doesn't loop","How do I ensure the decider TM doesn't loop? My current implementation keeps track of the configurations of the TM that have been read, and if we repeat a configuration without writing to any cell and end up in the same state to loop again, it rejects. Is this sufficient to catch cases that loop without ever accepting? Is there a way to use 15251 as an upper bound for the repeated states we visit before recognizing we are in a loop, or is my current method a better approach?","homework4.5",
